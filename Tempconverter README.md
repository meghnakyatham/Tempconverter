# Celsius to Fahrenheit Temperature Converter

This is a simple C program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The program takes the temperature in degrees Celsius as input from the user, performs the conversion, and then displays the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

## Getting Started

To run the Celsius to Fahrenheit converter on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. This program was tested with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code file `celsius_to_fahrenheit.c`.

4. Compile the program using the following command:


5. After successful compilation, run the executable:

- On Windows, use: `celsius_to_fahrenheit.exe`
- On macOS or Linux, use: `./celsius_to_fahrenheit`

## Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a temperature in degrees Celsius. Type the value and press `Enter`. The program will then perform the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:


where `Celsius` is the temperature entered by the user, and `Fahrenheit` is the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

After the conversion, the program will display the calculated temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

## Example

Suppose you want to convert 25 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit:


The program will show `77.000000` as the result, which is the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.
